# Tailwind Projects

I have been learning Tailwind recently, So I had some projects and practices that I'd like to have in my GitHub. These projects are based on the [tailwindfromscratch](https://tailwindfromscratch.com) course. Their tailwind course was beneficial and If you want to learn tailwind, I am sure this course is the best option for you.

This repo Includes 6 landing pages and 5 mini-projects, All of them were built by React & Tailwind, and no CSS was used except for some custom classes.

##Demo

Here is the Demo link of the Project [Link](https://tailwind-projects-rho.vercel.app/)
